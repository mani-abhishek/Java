""" 
There is an old bridge over river Ganga. Four people wants to cross the bridge at night. 
Many plants are missing, and the bridge can hold only two people at a time (any more than two, and the bridge collapses). 
The travellers must use a torch to guide their steps; otherwise theyâ€™re sure to step through a missing space and fall to their death. There is only one torch. 
The four people each travel at different speeds. Sharukh can cross the bridge in one minute; 
Aamir in two minutes; Salman takes five minutes; and the slowest person, Saif, takes ten minutes. 
The bridge is going to collapse in exactly seventeen minutes. How can all four people cross the bridge?
